# Improvement backlog

One item per scheduled run, top to bottom. Every item must leave the **interface identical** —
no changes to layout, colour, spacing, type, copy, animation timing or interaction model. Only
correctness, performance, robustness, accessibility and code quality.

Rules for adding items: only add things you have actually observed to be a problem, and say what
the symptom is. Do not add "refactor everything" style entries.

## Performance and fluidity

- [x] 1. Playlist rebuilt its whole innerHTML on every track change — reuse the rows and only move
  the `cur` class. *(1.5)*
- [x] 2. `timeupdate` writes four DOM values on every audio tick (~4/s). Skip the write when the
  rounded value has not changed.
- [x] 3. `restart()` forces a synchronous reflow with `void el.offsetWidth` on every call. Batch
  the class toggle into a `requestAnimationFrame` instead. *(1.7)* — done as a style flush
  (`getComputedStyle(el).animationName`) rather than a rAF: a single rAF runs before the frame's
  style recalc, so the removal is never observed and the animation does not restart, and rAF is
  paused while the page is hidden, which would leave the class off during background playback.
- [ ] 4. `touchTilt()` calls `getBoundingClientRect()` on every `touchmove`. Measure once at
  `touchstart` and reuse it for the gesture.
- [ ] 5. Settings are written to `localStorage` on every slider `input` event, including during a
  drag. Debounce the write to ~200 ms.
- [ ] 6. The blob animation keeps running while the player is collapsed to the bubble and while the
  page is hidden. Pause it in both states.
- [ ] 7. `paint()` writes nine CSS custom properties every frame, even when the value is unchanged.
  Compare against the previous value and skip identical writes.
- [ ] 8. `load()` re-queries the same DOM nodes on every call. Hoist the lookups into a single
  element map created once.
- [ ] 9. Audit for properties that trigger layout in hot paths (width/height/top/left) and replace
  with transforms where the visual result is identical.

## Robustness

- [ ] 10. `au.duration` can be `Infinity` or `NaN` for some files; every read site must guard it.
- [ ] 11. `au.play()` rejections are swallowed by `.catch(()=>{})`. Surface a non-intrusive state so
  the user knows playback was blocked rather than broken.
- [ ] 12. The "skip unplayable track" path can walk the whole playlist on a run of bad files. Cap
  the attempts and stop with a clear message.
- [ ] 13. A cancelled or empty file-picker result should leave the playlist untouched (verify, and
  fix if not).
- [ ] 14. Track hues from the golden-angle step can exceed 359 on long lists; clamp to 0–359.
- [ ] 15. `seek` input should be clamped to `[0, duration]` before assignment.
- [ ] 16. `deviceorientation` can deliver null `beta`/`gamma`; the guard exists but confirm it also
  handles the first event having only `alpha`.
- [ ] 17. Rapid taps on a playlist row can call `load()` twice for the same track; make it
  idempotent.
- [ ] 18. Rotation/resize can leave the card mid-tilt; re-measure and reset the tilt target.

## Memory and battery

- [ ] 19. Object URLs from the file picker are never revoked. Revoke a track's URL when the page is
  torn down, and on `pagehide`.
- [ ] 20. The `requestAnimationFrame` loop should stop when the document is hidden and restart on
  visibility.
- [ ] 21. Media session metadata is left behind when the player closes; clear it.

## Accessibility

- [ ] 22. Announce track changes with `aria-live="polite"` on the title block.
- [ ] 23. Give every range input an `aria-valuetext` describing its unit.
- [ ] 24. Ensure keyboard focus is visible on buttons (currently only `:active` is styled).
- [ ] 25. Give the playlist `role="list"` and its rows `role="listitem"`.

## Code quality

- [ ] 26. `synth()` builds a WAV for demo tracks that no real code path uses; confirm it is
  unreachable and remove it, or document why it stays.
- [ ] 27. Add a short architecture comment at the top of the script (state, render, audio, depth).
- [ ] 28. Unify the error strings ("Can't play this file", "Skipping…") into one helper.

## Android shell (`android/app/src/main/java/.../MainActivity.java`)

- [ ] 29. Request and abandon audio focus so other apps duck correctly.
- [ ] 30. Handle `onTrimMemory` by releasing the WebView's cache.
- [ ] 31. Guard against a WebView that fails to instantiate, with a plain-text fallback screen.
- [ ] 32. Confirm the file chooser returns `null` cleanly when the user backs out.
